# Shop-And-Kill-Monsters
## This is a small game developed in Python.
Version 1.0 of this game is played using input.<br>
However, we thought it was too boring, so we came up with version 2.0, which has a GUI.<br>
Currently, version 2.0 is still in development and is expected to be released in February and March.<br>
Thank you for your support, you can sponsor us, we will make better games.<br>
